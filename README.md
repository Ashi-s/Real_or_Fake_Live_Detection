# Real or Fake: Live Face Detection.
<br />
*Biometric recognition systems are continuing to be integrated as a part of security features across various fields to identify individuals. The subset of Facial recognition systems is becoming very popular due to the latest advancements in computer vision and machine learning, especially deep learning, but at the same time they are being attacked by spoofing a person’s identity to trick the system for access that should be denied.
<br />
*A spoof attack, a type of presentation attack, is the use of an artificial replica of a biometric used to circumvent a system. “Liveness detection” is a method used to recognize a presentation attack. In our case these attacks may be in the form of a printed image on paper or on a screen, a video of the person used to imitate a liveness etc.
<br />
*We propose to construct a liveness detector using a Deep Neural Network with convolutional layers by treating facial detection as a binary classification problem, i.e. a real or fake face being shown to our system so that we can mitigate such simple spoofs.
